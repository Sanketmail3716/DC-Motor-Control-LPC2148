# DC-Motor-Control-LPC2148
 This project demonstrates DC motor direction control using LPC2148 microcontroller. Two switches are used to control the motor's rotation direction (clockwise and anticlockwise) via GPIO pins. LEDs indicate motor direction. Written in Embedded C using Keil IDE, this project is ideal for beginners in embedded systems.
